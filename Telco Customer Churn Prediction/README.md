Telco Customer Churn Prediction - Deep Learning
Overview
This Jupyter notebook implements a deep learning solution for predicting customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and identifying factors that contribute to customer attrition in the telecommunications industry.

Dataset
The dataset used is the Telco Customer Churn Dataset from Kaggle, containing 7,043 customer records with 21 features including:

Demographic information: gender, senior citizen status, partner/dependents

Service information: phone service, multiple lines, internet service type

Service features: online security, online backup, device protection, tech support

Account information: contract type, paperless billing, payment method

Charges: monthly charges, total charges

Target variable: Churn (Yes/No)

Project Structure
1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
Mount Google Drive for data access

Load and inspect the dataset

Perform initial EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

2. Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values in TotalCharges column

Convert data types appropriately

Remove customerID column (identifier not useful for modeling)

Check for duplicates and handle data quality issues

3. Exploratory Data Analysis
Statistical summary of numerical features

Distribution analysis of categorical variables

Data visualization including pie charts for categorical distributions

Identification of feature patterns and relationships

4. Feature Analysis
Categorical Features (16):

Gender, Partner, Dependents, PhoneService, MultipleLines

InternetService, OnlineSecurity, OnlineBackup, DeviceProtection

TechSupport, StreamingTV, StreamingMovies, Contract

PaperlessBilling, PaymentMethod, Churn

Numerical Features (4):

SeniorCitizen, tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges

Key Findings from EDA
Data Quality Issues Addressed:
TotalCharges column converted from object to numeric type

11 missing values in TotalCharges handled using linear interpolation

22 duplicate records identified

Statistical Insights:
SeniorCitizen: Binary feature (0/1), imbalanced distribution

tenure: Continuous, approximately semi-normal distribution

MonthlyCharges: Continuous, near-normal distribution

TotalCharges: Continuous, right-skewed distribution

Technical Requirements
Libraries Used:
numpy, pandas - Data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn - Data visualization

scikit-learn - Data preprocessing and model evaluation

warnings - Suppress unnecessary warnings

Environment:
Python 3.11.13

Google Colab with GPU acceleration (NVIDIA Tesla T4)

Jupyter notebook format

Next Steps (Implied from Notebook Structure)
This notebook sets the foundation for:

Feature engineering and encoding categorical variables

Data normalization and scaling

Building deep learning models for churn prediction

Model training and evaluation

Hyperparameter tuning and optimization

Business Value
This project helps telecommunications companies:

Identify customers at risk of churning

Understand key factors driving customer attrition

Develop targeted retention strategies

Improve customer lifetime value

Usage
Run the notebook sequentially from top to bottom. Ensure the dataset path is correctly configured for your Google Drive setup. The notebook is designed to be executed in Google Colab environment but can be adapted for local execution.

Note
This appears to be an ongoing project where the current notebook covers data loading, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis. The deep learning modeling phase would typically follow in subsequent sections.
