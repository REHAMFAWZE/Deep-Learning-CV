🖼️ Image Classification Project — Intel Image Dataset

This project implements an image classification system using TensorFlow/Keras to classify natural and man-made scenes into six categories: mountain, street, glacier, buildings, sea, and forest.
It uses the Intel Image Classification Dataset and demonstrates a full deep learning pipeline from preprocessing to evaluation.

🧠 Overview

The notebook provides a complete workflow for multi-class image classification, including:

📦 Data loading & preprocessing

🔍 Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

🧱 Model building using CNNs or transfer learning

🧠 Model training and validation

📊 Performance evaluation with metrics and visualizations
